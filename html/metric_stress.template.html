<h4>Metric Stress</h4>

<p>
The stress of a projection measures the discrepancy between distances in the high-dimensional (i.e., geospatial) and the low-dimensional (i.e., projected) domain.
Stress values are scaled between 0 and 1, where 0 means no stress, which is desirable.
This is calculated as the normalized sum of squared residuals between the pairwise distances in the original and projected space.
