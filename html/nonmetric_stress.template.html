<h4>Nonmetric Stress</h4>

<p>
The stress of a projection measures the discrepancy between distances in the high-dimensional (i.e., geospatial) and the low-dimensional (i.e., projected) domain.
Stress values are scaled between 0 and 1, where 0 means no stress, which is desirable.
The nonmetric stress is calculated as the normalized sum of squared residuals between the pairwise disparities in the original and projected space.
The disparities operate on the rank order of the distances.
