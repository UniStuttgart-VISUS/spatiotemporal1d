<h4>M<sub>2</sub>: Neighborhood Preservation</h4>

<p>
This metric measures how well a <em>k</em>-neighborhood in the high-dimensional (i.e., geospatial) domain is preserved in the low-dimensional (i.e., projected timeline) domain.
The <em>k</em> is chosen based on the data.
The measure is normalized to the interval <span>[0, 1]</span>, where a value of 1 means perfect preservation of neighborhood.
