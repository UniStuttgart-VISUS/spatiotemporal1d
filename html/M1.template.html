<h4>M<sub>1</sub>: Neighborhood Trustworthiness</h4>

<p>
This metric signifies the number of data points in the low-dimensional (i.e., projected timeline) <em>k</em>-neighborhood that were not members of the high-dimensional (i.e., geospatial) neighborhood.
The <em>k</em> is chosen based on the data, and the high-dimensional distances are ranked (i.e., nonmetric).
The measure is normalized to the interval <span>[0, 1]</span>, where a value of 1 means perfect preservation of neighborhood.
